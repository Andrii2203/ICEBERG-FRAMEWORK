# MIGRATION ENGINE — TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (v1.0)
A deterministic engine for executing, validating, and governing website and system migrations under the Iceberg Method.

---

# 1. PURPOSE
The Migration Engine provides a fully governed, protocol‑driven system for executing website and application migrations with:

- zero improvisation  
- zero data loss  
- zero structural drift  
- full compliance with Iceberg standards  
- complete auditability  
- deterministic execution  

It transforms chaotic, manual migrations into predictable, repeatable, and fully validated workflows.

---

# 2. ROLE IN THE ICEBERG METHOD
Migration is one of the most error‑prone processes in digital development.  
The Migration Engine ensures:

- strict protocol adherence  
- consistent execution  
- full validation  
- memory‑driven continuity  
- reproducible results  
- cross‑team alignment  

It integrates deeply with:

- AI Executor  
- Memory Engine  
- Validation Engine  
- Iceberg Standards  
- Iceberg Protocols  

---

# 3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## 3.1 Inputs
Migration Engine receives:
- source system data  
- target system architecture  
- migration protocol  
- execution map  
- standards list  
- memory state  
- content models  
- QA requirements  

## 3.2 Outputs
Migration Engine produces:
- migrated content  
- migrated structure  
- mapping tables  
- validation reports  
- QA reports  
- logs  
- snapshots  
- compliance results  

## 3.3 Execution Flow
1. Load Migration Protocol  
2. Analyze source system  
3. Generate mapping  
4. Execute migration  
5. Validate results  
6. Run QA  
7. Update memory  
8. Produce final report

# 4. CORE COMPONENTS

## 4.1 Source Analyzer
Extracts:
- content  
- metadata  
- structure  
- relationships  
- assets  
- SEO data  

Ensures full visibility into the source system.

## 4.2 Mapping Engine
Creates:
- URL mapping  
- content mapping  
- component mapping  
- metadata mapping  
- SEO mapping  
- asset mapping  

Mapping must be deterministic and reproducible.

## 4.3 Migration Executor
Executes:
- content migration  
- structural migration  
- asset migration  
- metadata migration  
- SEO migration  

Follows the Migration Protocol strictly.

## 4.4 Validation Engine Integration
Validates:
- completeness  
- correctness  
- structure  
- SEO  
- accessibility  
- quality  
- mapping accuracy  

No migrated item may bypass validation.

## 4.5 QA Engine Integration
Runs:
- functional QA  
- visual QA  
- content QA  
- SEO QA  

Ensures the migrated system is production‑ready.

## 4.6 Memory Engine Integration
Stores:
- mapping history  
- migration logs  
- decisions  
- corrections  
- snapshots  

Ensures continuity across multi‑day migrations.

# 5. MIGRATION PROTOCOL

## 5.1 Required Protocols
- Iceberg Migration Protocol  
- Iceberg Migration QA Protocol  
- Iceberg Planning Protocol  
- Iceberg Execution Map (Card‑1, Card‑2, Card‑3)  

## 5.2 Protocol Rules
- no skipped steps  
- no reordering  
- no improvisation  
- no undocumented decisions  
- all corrections must be logged  

---

# 6. VALIDATION PIPELINE

## Stage 1 — Structural Validation
Checks:
- content completeness  
- metadata correctness  
- component structure  
- asset integrity  

## Stage 2 — Mapping Validation
Checks:
- URL mapping  
- content mapping  
- SEO mapping  
- metadata mapping  

## Stage 3 — Standards Validation
Applies:
- SEO Standard  
- Accessibility Standard  
- Website Quality Standard  
- Documentation Standard  
- Architecture Standard  

## Stage 4 — Semantic Validation
Checks:
- content meaning  
- correctness  
- consistency  

## Stage 5 — QA Validation
Checks:
- visual correctness  
- functional correctness  
- UX consistency  

## Stage 6 — Final Approval
Migration is approved only if all stages pass.

# 7. MIGRATION FILES

## Required Files
- `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`  
- `MAPPING_TABLE.md`  
- `MIGRATION_LOG.md`  
- `QA_REPORT.md`  
- `VALIDATION_LOG.md`  
- `CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.json`  

## Optional Files
- `SEO_AUDIT.md`

---

# 8. ERROR TYPES

## 8.1 Critical Errors
- missing content  
- broken mapping  
- incorrect structure  
- SEO regression  
- accessibility regression  
- protocol violation  

## 8.2 Major Errors
- incomplete metadata  
- incorrect formatting  
- partial migration  

## 8.3 Minor Errors
- typos  
- small formatting issues  

---

# 9. CORRECTION LOOP

If validation fails:
1. Validation Engine generates correction instructions  
2. Migration Engine applies corrections  
3. Validation Engine re‑validates  
4. Loop continues until approval  

No migrated item may bypass correction.

---

# 10. SECURITY MODEL

## 10.1 Isolation
Migration Engine must not:
- modify source system  
- modify target system outside migration scope  
- access external APIs without permission  

## 10.2 Logging
All actions must be logged.

## 10.3 Compliance
Migration Engine must follow:
- SECURITY.md  
- SECURITY_LOG.md
