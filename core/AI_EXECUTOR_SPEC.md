# AI EXECUTOR — TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (v1.0)
A deterministic execution engine for controlling AI behavior, enforcing standards, and producing reproducible outcomes.

---

# 1. PURPOSE
AI Executor is the core commercial module of the Iceberg Framework.  
Its purpose is to transform AI from an unpredictable assistant into a governed, protocol‑driven execution machine.

The Executor:
- interprets Iceberg Protocols  
- follows Execution Maps  
- enforces Standards  
- manages memory cycles  
- validates outputs  
- prevents improvisation  
- ensures deterministic behavior  

---

# 2. ROLE IN THE ICEBERG METHOD
AI Executor is the operational heart of the Iceberg Method.

It is responsible for:
- executing tasks according to strict rules  
- maintaining state and memory  
- coordinating multi‑step workflows  
- applying validation and QA  
- ensuring compliance with all standards  
- preventing deviation from protocols  

Without the Executor, Iceberg is only documentation.  
With the Executor, Iceberg becomes a **machine**.

# 3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## 3.1 Inputs
Executor receives:
- Task definition  
- Protocol reference  
- Execution Map card  
- Standards list  
- Memory state  
- Context (project, files, constraints)  

## 3.2 Outputs
Executor produces:
- validated results  
- structured artifacts  
- logs  
- memory updates  
- compliance reports  

## 3.3 Execution Flow
1. Load Protocol  
2. Load Execution Map  
3. Initialize Memory Cycle  
4. Execute Step  
5. Validate Output  
6. Apply Standards  
7. Update Memory  
8. Continue or Stop

# 4. CORE COMPONENTS

## 4.1 Protocol Interpreter
Reads and enforces:
- Planning Protocol  
- Execution Protocol  
- Migration Protocol  
- QA Protocol  
- Validation Protocol  

Ensures:
- no skipped steps  
- no reordering  
- no improvisation  

## 4.2 Execution Map Engine
Executes:
- Card‑1 (Planning)  
- Card‑2 (Execution)  
- Card‑3 (Validation)  

Each card defines:
- steps  
- checkpoints  
- fallback logic  
- memory rules  

## 4.3 Standards Enforcer
Applies:
- Documentation Standard  
- Architecture Standard  
- API Interaction Standard  
- SEO Standard  
- PWA Standard  
- Website Quality Standard  
- Technology‑specific standards (Next.js, React, Angular, etc.)

Ensures:
- compliance  
- consistency  
- reproducibility  

## 4.4 Memory Engine Integration
Works with the Persistent Memory Engine to:
- store task drafts  
- store execution logs  
- store decisions  
- store context  
- restore state  

Memory discipline is mandatory.

## 4.5 Validation Engine Integration
Validates:
- correctness  
- completeness  
- compliance  
- structure  
- quality  

---

# 5. EXECUTION MODES

## 5.1 Deterministic Mode (default)
- strict protocol enforcement  
- no improvisation  
- no creative deviation  
- full validation  

## 5.2 Assisted Mode
- allows controlled creativity  
- still enforces standards  
- still validates output  

## 5.3 Autonomous Mode (enterprise)
- multi‑task execution  
- long‑running workflows  
- cross‑project memory  
- scheduled tasks  

---

# 6. MEMORY CYCLE

## 6.1 Required Files
- ICEBERG_TASK_DRAFT.md  
- MEMORY_LOG.md  
- EXECUTION_LOG.md  

## 6.2 Rules
- Executor must always return to the task draft  
- No memory may be discarded  
- All decisions must be logged  
- All context must be preserved  

---

# 7. VALIDATION PIPELINE

1. Structural validation  
2. Standard compliance  
3. Protocol compliance  
4. Semantic validation  
5. QA validation  
6. Final approval  

If any step fails → Executor must correct the output.

---

# 8. SECURITY MODEL

## 8.1 Isolation
Executor must not:
- access external APIs without permission  
- modify files outside the project  
- execute arbitrary code  

## 8.2 Logging
All actions must be logged.

## 8.3 Compliance
Executor must follow:
- SECURITY.md  
- SECURITY_LOG.md  

---

# 9. EXTENSIBILITY

## 9.1 Technology Adapters
Executor supports adapters for:
- Next.js  
- React  
- Angular  
- Node.js / NestJS  
- Laravel  
- Django  
- Flutter  

## 9.2 Custom Protocols
Enterprises may define:
- custom workflows  
- custom standards  
- custom validation rules
