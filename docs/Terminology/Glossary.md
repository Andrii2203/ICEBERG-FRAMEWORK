# ICEBERG FRAMEWORK — TERMINOLOGY / GLOSSARY
A unified glossary of terms used across the Iceberg Framework.  
Ensures semantic consistency, determinism, and unambiguous communication between humans and AI.

---

# 1. PURPOSE
This glossary defines all core terms used in standards, protocols, execution maps, and documentation.  
All documents must use these terms exactly as defined here.

---

# 2. CORE CONCEPTS

## 2.1 Iceberg Framework
A deterministic system of standards, protocols, and execution maps designed to control AI‑assisted development.

## 2.2 Determinism
A property of the framework where every action, rule, and process produces predictable, reproducible results.

## 2.3 Standard
A document defining rules, constraints, and requirements for a specific domain (coding, documentation, architecture, etc.).

## 2.4 Protocol
A structured, step‑based procedure that defines how to execute a specific type of task.

## 2.5 Execution Map
A multi‑stage workflow describing how to complete a complex task from start to finish.

## 2.6 STOP‑CHECK
A mandatory validation point inside a protocol or execution map where progress must pause until conditions are met.

## 2.7 Artifact
Any file, document, or output produced during execution of a protocol or map.

---

# 3. STRUCTURAL TERMS

## 3.1 Layer
A logical grouping of framework components:
- Standards Layer  
- Protocols Layer  
- Execution Layer  

## 3.2 Primary Palette
The core brand colors used in the iceberg symbol and identity system.

## 3.3 Accent Palette
UI‑interaction colors used for links, hover states, and secondary text.

## 3.4 Semantic Color Mapping
A mapping where each color represents a conceptual role (depth, structure, visibility, boundary).

## 3.5 Waterline
A conceptual boundary separating visible and invisible parts of the system.

---

# 4. DOCUMENT TYPES

## 4.1 Standard Document
Defines rules and constraints.  
Examples: CODING_RULES.md, DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md.

## 4.2 Protocol Document
Defines step‑based procedures.  
Examples: PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md, MIGRATION_PROTOCOL.md.

## 4.3 Execution Map
Defines multi‑stage workflows.  
Examples: EXECUTION_MAP_CARD_1.md.

## 4.4 Log Document
Chronological record of events.  
Examples: SECURITY_LOG.md.

## 4.5 Governance Document
Defines roles, responsibilities, and processes for maintainers.

---

# 5. AI‑RELATED TERMS

## 5.1 AI Agent
Any AI system interacting with the framework.

## 5.2 Memory Model
A structured approach to storing and retrieving persistent information.

## 5.3 Context Window
The active scope of information available to an AI agent during execution.

## 5.4 Ambiguity
Any unclear instruction or undefined term.  
Must be resolved before execution continues.

## 5.5 Deterministic Output
An output that remains consistent across repeated executions.

---

# 6. DEVELOPMENT TERMS

## 6.1 Architecture
The structural organization of a project, defined by Iceberg standards.

## 6.2 Component
A reusable unit of UI or logic.

## 6.3 Content Model
A structured definition of content types and their fields.

## 6.4 Migration
The process of transforming an existing project into Iceberg‑compliant form.

## 6.5 Refactor
A structural improvement without changing external behavior.

---

# 7. BRAND TERMS

## 7.1 Iceberg Symbol
The geometric logo representing the framework.

## 7.2 Visible Tip
The part of the iceberg above the waterline; represents UI and documentation.

## 7.3 Submerged Mass
The part below the waterline; represents logic, standards, and protocols.

## 7.4 Frozen Gray
The boundary color representing separation between layers.

---

# 8. VERSIONING TERMS

## 8.1 Major Version
Introduces breaking changes or new architectural rules.

## 8.2 Minor Version
Adds new features, standards, or maps without breaking compatibility.

## 8.3 Patch Version
Fixes issues, clarifies documentation, or improves consistency.

## 8.4 Release Notes
A document summarizing changes between versions.

---

# 9. COMPLIANCE
All documents, protocols, and execution maps must use these terms exactly as defined.  
No synonyms or alternative interpretations are allowed.
