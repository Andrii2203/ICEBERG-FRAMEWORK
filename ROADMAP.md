# ICEBERG FRAMEWORK — ROADMAP

A deterministic development roadmap for the Iceberg Framework.  
Focused on standards, protocols, execution maps, and ecosystem expansion.

---

## 1. PURPOSE
This roadmap defines the planned evolution of the Iceberg Framework.  
It ensures predictability, transparency, and structured growth of all components.

---

# 2. CORE PILLARS

- **Standards** — architectural, quality, SEO, PWA, accessibility  
- **Protocols** — AI behavior, planning, memory, migration  
- **Execution Maps** — deterministic workflows  
- **Templates** — reproducible documentation  
- **Brand System** — identity, UI, semantics  
- **Ecosystem Tools** — generators, validators, linters  

---

# 3. ROADMAP PHASES

## PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (Completed / In Progress)
**Goal:** Establish the core identity and operational standards.

### Deliverables
- BrandBook.md (v2)  
- Logo system + semantic color mapping  
- Initial standards:
  - Next.js Architecture Standard  
  - Website Quality Standard  
  - PWA Standard  
  - Accessibility Standard  
  - SEO Technical Standard  
  - API Interaction Standard  
- Core protocols:
  - AI Execution Standard  
  - Planning Protocol v0.1 → v0.2  
  - Persistent Memory Standard  
  - Migration Protocol + QA Protocol  
- Execution Map — Card 1 (Greenfield Website Creation)

**Status:** 100% complete

---

## PHASE 2 — DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM (Next)
**Goal:** Create a unified documentation layer for humans and AI.

### Deliverables
- `/docs/` restructuring  
- Iceberg Documentation Standard  
- Glossary / Terminology  
- SECURITY.md  
- SECURITY_LOG.md  
- ROADMAP.md (this document)  
- CONTRIBUTING.md  
- Versioning rules (Iceberg Semantic Versioning)

**Outcome:**  
A deterministic documentation system that any AI agent can follow without ambiguity.

---

## PHASE 3 — EXECUTION MAP EXPANSION
**Goal:** Extend deterministic workflows to more scenarios.

### New Execution Maps
- **Card 2:** Migration (Legacy → Iceberg)  
- **Card 3:** Refactor to Iceberg Architecture  
- **Card 4:** Multi‑language Website Setup  
- **Card 5:** API‑Driven Project Setup  
- **Card 6:** AI‑Assisted QA & Validation  

### Enhancements
- STOP‑CHECK refinements  
- Cross‑map consistency rules  
- Execution Map Generator Template  

---

## PHASE 4 — TOOLING ECOSYSTEM
**Goal:** Provide tools that enforce Iceberg determinism.

### Deliverables
- Iceberg Project Generator (CLI)  
- Iceberg Validator (architecture + quality checks)  
- Iceberg Linter (naming, structure, file rules)  
- Iceberg Memory Inspector (AI‑focused)  
- Iceberg Migration Assistant  

**Outcome:**  
A full ecosystem that enforces standards automatically.

---

## PHASE 5 — WEBSITE & UI SYSTEM
**Goal:** Build the official Iceberg Framework website.

### Deliverables
- icebergframework.org  
- Documentation portal  
- Interactive Execution Maps  
- Brand‑aligned UI Kit  
- Component library (React / Next.js)  
- Dark/Light modes based on brand palette  

**Outcome:**  
A public, structured, deterministic representation of the framework.

---

## PHASE 6 — COMMUNITY & GOVERNANCE
**Goal:** Establish long‑term sustainability.

### Deliverables
- Governance model  
- Maintainer roles  
- Issue triage protocol  
- Security response protocol  
- Release cycles  
- Public roadmap updates
