# LEGAL STRUCTURE — ICEBERG FRAMEWORK
A complete legal architecture defining ownership, licensing, boundaries, and rights for all components of the Iceberg Method and Iceberg Framework.

---

# 1. PURPOSE
This document defines the full legal structure of the Iceberg ecosystem, including:

- intellectual property boundaries  
- open‑source vs proprietary separation  
- licensing model  
- commercial rights  
- restrictions  
- brand protection  
- contributor rules  
- enterprise usage rules  

It ensures that Iceberg Framework can be safely published, used, extended, and commercialized without ambiguity.
